        training for power, build better balance and coordination, and even

        Speed bags help a fighter learn to keep his or her hands up, improve
        hand-eye coordination, and learn to shift weight between feet when
        punching. They are also known as speedballs or speed ball bags. They are
        generally filled with air and fitted around a tight PU-based or leather
        material.

        The slip line is performed by moving the head to either side so that the
        opponent's punches "slip" by the boxer. Slipping punches allows the
        fighter to recover quicker and counter punches faster than the opponent
        can reset into proper fighting stance. In boxing, timing is known to be
        a key factor in the outcome.
